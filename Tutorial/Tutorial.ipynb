    "**Sensitivity to Lighting Conditions:** \n",
    "- The current detection performance is influenced by varying lighting conditions. To enhance accuracy, it's advisable to expand the training dataset to include diverse lighting scenarios. The existing dataset, comprising fewer than 200 samples, could benefit from augmentation with more training samples. Increased data variety is likely to yield improved detection accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Overlapping Pieces:** \n",
    "- Detecting components becomes challenging when multiple pieces overlap, particularly when several pieces are connected in parallel, the shadow they formed will make detection of the wires between them difficult. Addressing this challenge requires the creation of a more extensive training dataset that specifically includes cases of overlapping wires and pieces. While previous efforts have shown performance improvements with additional training data, further enhancements are possible in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Error Correction:** \n",
    "- The `round_to_integer_with_error` function serves a critical role in mitigating errors that can arise from imprecise drawings of the pieces' bounding boxes or improper placement of pieces. In such scenarios, there's a possibility that these pieces may seem to pass through neighboring pegs, leading to potential inaccuracies such as oversized pieces or incorrect connections.\n",
    "- It's important to note that this error correction method involves the incorporation of a customizable error rate. Fine-tuning this error rate is essential to ensure precise and reliable error correction."

    "1. Hand Detection Model:\n",
    "    - This model is designed to recognize whose hand it is by analyzing the direction of the fingers. It's important to note that this capability is currently effective when people are sitting face to face, where their fingers are pointing toward each other. \n",
    "    - For in-depth exploration and utilization of this hand detection model, you can refer to the code located in `cvzone_hand.py`. Additionally, discover its implementation and video storage procedures in the `gesture.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "2. Holistic Model with Hand, Pose, and Face Detection:\n",
    "    - Our Holistic Model is built to provide a comprehensive understanding of human subjects. While there are opportunities for performance enhancement, the model's potential is substantial. It offers the capability to assimilate intricate details such as facial expressions and body language, which play pivotal roles in gauging emotions and confidence.\n",
    "    - For practical implementation, you can explore two primary functionalities in the `mediapipe.ipynb` notebook: single human detection and detection of two individuals using YOLO (which uses human identification + cropping regions of interest + deploying the Holistic Model)."

    "\n",
    "**1. Enhanced Hand Model Functionality:**\n",
    "- At present, our hand model performs reliably when tracking two individuals seated face-to-face. However, there are opportunities for improvement:\n",
    "    - Exploring the integration of a tracking mechanism to follow multiple (>2) individuals and allocate unique identifiers (IDs) to each person.\n",
    "    - Investigating methods to distinguish between individuals when they are seated side by side. This can be challenging due to variations in finger orientation when reaching toward objects at varying distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Integration of Hand Model into the Holistic Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When individuals are seated face-to-face, achieving an optimal camera angle to capture both individuals' frontal views can be a challenging task. Introducing multiple cameras, however, brings about new challenges, such as dealing with an increased volume of information to process and potentially limiting user mobility due to the presence of more equipment.\n",
    "- The use of YOLO for person detection may encounter instability issues when individuals overlap with each other. I would recommend delving into advanced research on multiple people tracking as an alternative to human detection using YOLO."
