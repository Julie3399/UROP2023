    "- **colabtutorial**: https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov8-object-detection-on-custom-dataset.ipynb This is the original file of the notebook, in order to use this notebok for training, something should be modified(will explain later)\n",
    "- **Roboflow**: We use this website to create the training data, by uploading pictures of the circuits and labeling the components. Please contact Joy to add you into the workspace so that you can use the training data created by Joy and Julie. After fully understand how it works, you are encouraged to create your own workspace and your own training data as the outcome really depends on the training image(light condition, image quality and filming angle .etc) and the quality of labeling."

    "- Create your own account of Azure to get your API keys and region key.\n",
    "- Better to use Linux than using Macos: We have to download the SpeechSDK. The SpeechSDK for Macos is a combinition of ArmX86 and X86, and it only contains the name of the required library but no contents with it. Another difficulty is that you should link to the dynamic libraries yourself and maybe you can do that.\n",
    "- Lack of SpeechSDK in Python version. The 2 main functions that we want to use through Azure are:\n",
    "    - Speaker Recognition\n",
    "    - Real Time Diarization (currently under public review)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is my main coding Language, since the current SDK do not support the the above two functions in Python, I tried to use them in C++ with linux (tried C++ with Macos first but don't know how to link to the dynamic libraries) and still faced some problems:\n",
    "- The current code can be compiled but still has loads of bugs. Code is from: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/get-started-speaker-recognition?tabs=script&pivots=programming-language-cpp I have never used C++ before so it is really hard for me to debug so I may leave this to you if you are familiar with C++.\n",

    "Once again, our code is based on the github repository https://github.com/zachlatta/openai-whisper-speaker-identification/blob/main/transcripts_with_speaker_names.ipynb. Currently, we cannot use it for real time diarization, it can only take a audio file as input then the output will be a txt file telling you 'who speak what'. The format will be like the following:<br>\n",
    "- speaker 1: hello.....\n",
    "- speaker 2: hi......<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current method is to record the real time audio for 40 seconds(can be adjusted), then put it into the dirization function meanwhile start to record audio for another 40 seconds. The disadvantage is that we will always have a 50-second-delay(include the processing time). **real_time_speaker_diart** and **transcripts_with_speaker_names** acctually using the same code from the github repository while the former one contains a recorder function inside the file and the latter one contains only the diarization function with all other helper function in seperate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **recorder**: contains a recorder function which will record the real time audio and save it as a file in the same directory for every 20 seconds (duration can be changed).\n",
    "- **check_for_new_file**: contains a function that will search for new files in the current directory and return the name of new-added files. we then can pass the new-added function into the 'transcripts_with_...' file to process it and store all transcripts into the file named **transcript.txt**.\n",
    "- **GPT**: Since we may need to find contribution of each participant through their conversation, we may use a language model to help us to estimate their ability based on the transcipt. So this is a function to pass the text in **initial_promp** together with the **transcript** in to ChatGPT and get the generated-output back. One should have a valid API key for ChatGPT with credit inside the account."
