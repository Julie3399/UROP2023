    "This model is to detect the circuit components and return all the needed information such as the names and the positions of the components. We are using the **Roboflow** website combiing with a colab tutorial to train the data.\n",
    "- **colabtutorial**: https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov8-object-detection-on-custom-dataset.ipynb This is the original file of the notebook, in order to use this notebok for training, something should be modified(will explain later)\n",
    "- **Roboflow**: We use this website to create the training data, by uploading pictures of the circuits and labeling the components. Please contact Joy to add you into the workspace so that you can use the training data created by Joy and Julie. After fully understand how it works, you are encouraged to create your own workspace and your own training data as the outcome really depends on the training image(light condition, image quality and filming angle .etc) and the quality of labeling."

    "Then you can train the model, you can then run the rest of the cell to see the output, but the output might seem to be really bad. That is because one can not delete pictures from the roboflow but only add more pictures or modify the labeling. So we put all the unwanted pictures into the test set in order to keep it away from the training set. Then all you need to do is to deploy the model by running the following cell:\n",

One should note that once you create a dataset, you can not remove pictures from it eventhough you may think that some of the pictures will influence the training outcome in a bad way. So be carefull with your mian custom dataset. One trick that you can use is to allowcate all the bad pictures into the \"test set\". The website will automatically split the whole data set into 3 parts: training set, validation set and test set and you have the right to modify it.\n",

That is to say, when you crop the shape of a cirtain component, you should make it as accurate as possible as a little difference on the location will influence the outcome very hugely. You are welcomed to follow our pattern to label them or using your own way. However, the boundary of the components should be very accurate when you are labeling them. \n",
