Here's an introduction to files in this folder:

1. The main function that may be use for to your project will be in the section of the 'Color Picker' inside the file `color_picker.ipynb`. It uses OpenCV to capture video from the default camera and apply color filtering based on the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values set by trackbars. It displays the original video, the mask highlighting the selected color range, and the resulting image with the selected color. You can use the track bar to adjust the filter to get a better masking of the selected color.

2. The `facial_detecting` file is kind of useless based on our current idea. It reqires pretraining to collect the facial informations of the participants then recognize their faces when needed. The drawback is that we need loads of pictures to do the pretraining, which may not suitable to our project.

3. More information of the `color_picker` will be in the tutorials.
