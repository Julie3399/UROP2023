    "# Yolov8 Model\n",
    "This model is to detect the circuit components and return all the needed information such as the names and the positions of the components. We are using the **Roboflow** website combiing with a colab tutorial to train the data.\n",
    "- **colabtutorial**: https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov8-object-detection-on-custom-dataset.ipynb This is the original file of the notebook, in order to use this notebok for training, something should be modified(will explain later)\n",
    "- **Roboflow**: We use this website to create the training data, by uploading pictures of the circuits and labeling the components. Please contact Joy to add you into the workspace so that you can use the training data created by Joy and Julie. After fully understand how it works, you are encouraged to create your own workspace and your own training data as the outcome really depends on the training image(light condition, image quality and filming angle .etc) and the quality of labeling."
